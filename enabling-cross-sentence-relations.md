# Enabling cross-sentence relations (Experimental)
{: #enabling-cross-sentence-relations}

English entities and relations workspaces that you create can support annotating relations between pairs of entity mentions that exist within spans of six sentences. In workspaces where the cross-sentence relations feature is not enabled, the ground truth editor and runtime models do not support annotating relations that cross sentence boundaries.
{: shortdesc}

Cross-sentence relations is an experimental feature that might be discontinued without notice. It is not recommended to use this feature in a production environment.
{: important}

Enabling cross-sentence relations might decrease the performance of the ground truth editor and the performance of any models that you deploy from the workspace at runtime.
The cross-sentence relations setting cannot be changed for a workspace after it is created.
{: note}

For example, if you plan to annotate a relation for an entity mention in the seventh sentence below, you are limited to selecting other entity mentions only in the seventh sentence unless you enable cross-sentence relations. With the feature enabled, you can annotate a related entity mention within a span of six sentences (across up to five sentence boundaries), so the second entity mention in the relation could be annotated anywhere from the second sentence to the twelfth sentence.
