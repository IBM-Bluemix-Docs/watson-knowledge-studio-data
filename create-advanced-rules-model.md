## Before you begin
{: #create-advanced-rules-model-before-you-begin}

1. [Install {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}}](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-install).
1. Confirm you are using a [supported browser](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-system-requirements).

## Creating an advanced rules model
{: #create-advanced-rules-model-procedure}

Advanced rules models are comprised of text extractors that you design in the advanced rules workspace. The advanced rules workspace provides sample text extractors that are ready to use. 

1. Create an advanced rules workspace

    1. [Launch the {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} application](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-wks_tutintro#launching-the-knowledge-studio-application).
    1. If you already have other workspaces, click **Create workspace**.
    1. Click **Create advanced rules workspace**. Enter a name for your workspace, then click **Create**. The advanced rules workspace will load after a few seconds.

1. Create a new project (optional)

    ![New project button](images/create-advanced-rules-project.png "Shows the New project button") 
    1. In the **Projects** tab of your workspace, click the **New** button.
    2. Enter a name for your project and click **Create**.

    For more details, see [Managing projects and extractors](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-managing-projects-and-extractors)

1. Add documents to your project

    ![Add Documents button](images/advanced-rules-add-documents.png "Shows the Add Documents button")

    4. Click **Add** to add your file to the project.

1. Create an extractor

    1. Follow the tutorials from the **Get Help** menu for more information on how to create and run extractors. See [Managing projects and extractors > Creating an extractor](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-managing-projects-and-extractors#creating-an-extractor).

1. Run your extractors on documents

    1. Right-click the extractor on the canvas and click Run Selected from the menu. 
    2. Alternatively, select the extractor and click Run Selected from the extractor toolbar.
