# Bootstrapping annotation
{: #preannotation}

Simplify the job of the human annotator by pre-annotating the documents in a workspace. A pre-annotator is a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} dictionary, rule-based model, or machine learning model that you can run to find and annotate mentions automatically.
{: shortdesc}

Pre-annotation makes the job of human annotators easier because it covers the straightforward annotations, and gets the job of annotating the documents underway.

The method that you use to pre-annotate documents in no way restricts the ways that you can use the resulting model. For example, just because you use the {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}} service to pre-annotate documents does not mean you must deploy the final machine learning model that you build to the {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}} service. Pre-annotation is solely meant to bootstrap the human annotation process.

## Important notes
{: #preannotation_notes}

- Never run a pre-annotator on documents that human annotators have annotated because the annotations added by the human annotators will be removed.
- You can run only one pre-annotator on documents. If you run one pre-annotator, and then run a second pre-annotator, the second pre-annotator will remove the annotations that were added by the first pre-annotator. Pick the pre-annotation method that best fits your use case, and use only that one pre-annotator.

## Pre-annotation methods
{: #preannotation_methods}

The following pre-annotators are available:

- **Dictionary**

    Uses a dictionary of terms that you provide and associate with an entity type to find mentions of that entity type in the documents. This choice is best for fields with unique or specialized terminology because this pre-annotator does not analyze the context in which the term is used in the way a machine learning pre-annotator does; it instead relies on the term being distinct enough to have a decipherable meaning regardless of the context in which it is used. For example, it is easier to recognize *asbestos* as a mineral entity type than to determine the entity type of *squash*, which can refer to a vegetable, a sport, or a verb meaning to crush something.

  Dictionary pre-annotators do not recognize entity subtypes. Human annotators can specify entity subtypes for each pre-annotated mention by working on an [annotation task](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documents#wks_hatask) with the pre-annotated document.

- **Machine learning**

    Uses a machine learning model to automatically annotate documents. This option is only available to you if you have created a machine learning model with {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} already. If you add a new document set, you can run the machine learning annotator that you created previously to pre-annotate the new documents. If the new set of documents are similar to the documents that were used to train the machine learning annotator originally, then this is probably your best choice for pre-annotation.

- **Rule**

    Uses a rule-based model to automatically annotate documents. This option is only available if you have created a rule-based model with {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} already. If your documents contain common patterns of tokens from which you can derive meaning, this model might be a good choice. It can incorporate some of the function of the dictionary pre-annotator if you enable it, by identifying class types for dictionary terms that it finds in the documents also.

Alternatively, you can upload already-annotated documents, and use them to start training the machine learning model. You cannot run a pre-annotator on annotated documents that you upload or the existing annotations will be stripped from the documents and replaced with annotations produced by the pre-annotator only.

> **Note:** You *can* run a pre-annotator on documents that were added to the ground truth as part of the current workspace. Annotations that were added to the documents, reviewed, accepted, and promoted to ground truth within the current workspace are not stripped out.

## Pre-annotating documents with a dictionary
{: #wks_preannot}

To help human annotators get started with their annotation tasks, you can create a dictionary and use it to pre-annotate documents that you add to the corpus.

### About this task
{: #wks_preannot_about}

When a human annotator begins work on documents that were pre-annotated, it is likely that a number of mentions will already be marked by entity types based on the dictionary entries. The human annotator can change or remove the pre-annotated entity types and assign entity types to unannotated mentions. Pre-annotation by a dictionary does not annotate relations, coreferences. Relations and coreferences must be annotated by human annotators.

**Note**: This task shows how to create a dictionary that is editable. If you want to upload and pre-annotate your documents with a read-only dictionary, click the **Menu** icon next to the **Create Dictionary** button. Select **Upload Dictionary**.

### Procedure
{: #wks_preannot_procedure}

To create an editable dictionary and pre-annotate documents:

1. Log in as a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} administrator and select your workspace.
2. Select the **Assets** > **Dictionaries** page.
3. Click **Create Dictionary**, enter a name, and then click **Save**.
4. From the **Entity type** list, select an entity type to associate with the dictionary.
5. Add entries for the dictionary or upload a file that contains dictionary terms.
6. Click **Machine Learning Model** > **Pre-annotation**.
7. On the **Dictionaries** tab, click **Apply This Pre-annotator**.
8. Select the check box for each document set that you want to pre-annotate and click **Run**.

    Pre-annotation is applied to individual documents without regard for the various document sets or annotation sets that a document might belong to. A document that overlaps between a selected document set and an unselected document set will be pre-annotated in both document sets.

9. After the dictionary is created, click **Run** any time that you want to use the dictionary to pre-annotate additional document sets that you add to the corpus.

    > **Restriction:** If you edit the dictionary to add or remove entries, you must re-create annotation tasks that include the pre-annotated document sets. Pre-annotation based on the changes that you make to the dictionary annotator cannot be applied to annotation sets that are already assigned to an annotation task.

## Pre-annotating documents with the machine learning model
{: #wks_preannotsire}

You can use an existing machine learning model to pre-annotate documents that you add to your corpus.

### About this task
{: #wks_preannotsire_about}

After 10 to 30 documents are annotated, a machine learning model can be trained on the data. Such a minimally-trained model should not be used in a production, but can be used to pre-annotate documents to help speed up the human annotation of subsequent documents. For example, if you add documents to the corpus after you train a machine learning model, you can use the model to pre-annotate the new document sets. Never run a pre-annotator on the same documents that have been annotated by a person. Pre-annotators remove human annotation.

### Procedure
{: #wks_preannotsire_procedure}

To use an existing machine learning model to pre-annotate documents:

1. Log in as a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} administrator and select your workspace.
2. Select **Machine Learning Model** > **Versions**.
3. To pre-annotate new documents, click **Run this model**.
4. Select the check box for each document set that you want to pre-annotate and click **Run**.

    Pre-annotation is applied to individual documents without regard for the various document sets or annotation sets that a document might belong to. A document that overlaps between a selected document set and an unselected document set will be pre-annotated in both document sets.

5. You can click **Run this model** any time that you want to use the machine learning model to pre-annotate additional document sets that you add to the corpus.

## Pre-annotating documents with the rule-based model
{: #wks_preannotrule}

You can use an existing rule-based model to pre-annotate documents that you add to your corpus.

### Procedure
{: #wks_preannotrule_procedure}

To use the rule-based model to pre-annotate documents, complete the following steps:

1. Log in as a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} administrator and select your workspace.
1. Select the **Rule-based Model** > **Versions** > **Rule-based Model** tab.
1. If not already completed, click **Map entity types and classes** to map entity types that you defined in the {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} type system to one or more rule-based model classes.
2. Click **Edit** for each entity type you want to map.

    - The drop-down list of the **Class Name** column is pre-populated with classes that are associated with the rule-based model.
    - You must map at least one entity type to a class.

3. On the **Rule-based Model** tab, click **Run this model**.

    The **Run this model** button is not available until you map at least one entity type to a class.

4. Select the document sets or annotation sets that you want to pre-annotate. Ensure that the sets you select do not contain documents that have human annotations. Pre-annotators remove human annotation.
5. Click **Run**.

    Pre-annotation is applied to individual documents without regard for the various document sets that a document might belong to. A document that overlaps between a selected document set and an unselected document will appear pre-annotated in both document sets.

6. You can click **Run this model** any time that you want to use the rule-based model to pre-annotate additional document sets that you add to the corpus.

    > **Restriction:** If you edit the entity type-to-class mapping of the rule-based model, then you must re-create annotation tasks that include the pre-annotated document sets. Pre-annotation based on the changes that you make to the pre-annotator mapping definition cannot be applied to document sets that are already assigned to an annotation task.

## Uploading pre-annotated documents
{: #wks_uima}

You can jump-start the training of your model by uploading documents that were pre-annotated through an Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) analysis engine.

The pre-annotated documents must be in the XMI serialization form of UIMA Common Analysis Structure (UIMA CAS XMI). The ZIP file that you upload must include the UIMA TypeSystem descriptor file and a file that maps the UIMA types to entity types in your {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} type system.

UIMA CAS XMI is a standard format of Apache UIMA. Guidelines are provided for how to create files in the correct format from analyzed collections in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer. If you use another Apache UIMA implementation, adapt these guidelines for your purposes. Regardless of how you create the XMI files, the requirements for creating the type system mapping file and ZIP file are the same for everyone.

If you assign the imported documents to human annotators, the documents appear pre-annotated in the ground truth editor and a number of mentions might already be annotated. The human annotator thus has more time to focus on applying the annotation guidelines to unmarked mentions. Alternatively, you can bypass the human annotation step and use the pre-annotated documents to immediately start training and evaluating a machine learning model.

### Exporting analyzed documents from Watson Explorer Content Analytics
{: #wks_uimawexca}

You can export documents that were crawled and analyzed in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer Content Analytics, and upload the analyzed documents as XMI files into a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace.

#### Procedure
{: #wks_uima_procedure}

To get analyzed documents from a {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer Content Analytics collection:

1. Open the Content Analytics administration console in a web browser.
1. On the Collections view, expand the collection that you want to export documents from. In the Parse and Index pane, ensure that the parse and index process is running, and then click the arrow icon for **Export analyzed document content and metadata**.
1. In the **Analyzed document export options** area, select **Export documents as XML files**, select the **Enable CAS as XMI format export** check box, specify the output path for where the exported data is to be written, and click **OK**.
1. Stop and restart the parse and index services for the collection, and then do one of the following steps:

    - If the collection already contains indexed documents that you want to use for training the machine learning model in the document cache, restart a full index build.
    - If the collection does not contain indexed documents that you want to use for training the machine learning model, upload documents, configure at least one crawler to crawl the documents, and start the crawler.

1. In the **Export** area, check the status of the export request. The progress indicates how many documents are exported.
1. Go to the output folder that you specified when you configured export options. When documents are exported as XML files, the output folder name is based on the time stamp when the export occurs. The output folder contains XMI files (`*.xmi`) and the UIMA TypeSystem descriptor file (`exported_typesystem.xml`).

#### What to do next
{: #wks_uimawexca__preUIMAimport}

You must define a mapping between the UIMA types and {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} entity types. You must also create a ZIP file that contains all the files that are required to upload the analyzed data into a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace.

### Exporting an analyzed collection from Content Analytics Studio
{: #wks_uimawexstudio}

You can export a collection of analyzed documents from {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer Content Analytics Studio, and upload the analyzed documents as XMI files into a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} project.

#### Procedure
{: #wks_uimawexstudio_procedure}

To get analyzed documents from a Content Analytics Studio collection:

1. Launch Content Analytics Studio and open the Studio project.
1. Right-click a folder that contains documents that you want to use for training a machine learning model and select **Analyze Collection**.
1. Select a UIMA pipeline configuration file.
1. Go to the Collection Analysis view and click the **Save** icon in the Collection Analysis view. Specify the folder where the saved results are to be written and specify the file name.
1. Open the folder that you specified. The file extension of the saved file is `.annotations`.
1. Copy the `.annotations` file to your local file system and rename the file extension from `.annotations` to `.zip`.
1. Extract all files from the ZIP file. The extracted contents include XMI files (`*.xmi`), the UIMA TypeSystem descriptor file (`TypeSystem.xml`), and other files.

#### What to do next
{: #wks_uimawexstudio_next}

You must define a mapping between the UIMA types and {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} entity types. You must also create a ZIP file that contains all of the files that are required to upload the analyzed data into a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace.

### Mapping UIMA types to entity types
{: #wks_uimawexmap}

Before you upload XMI files into a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace, you must define mappings between the UIMA types and {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} entity types.

#### Before you begin
{: #wks_uimawexmap_prereqs}

The type system in your {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace must include the entity types that you want to map the UIMA types to.

#### Procedure
{: #wks_uimawexmap_procedure}

To map UIMA types to {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} entity types:

1. Create a file named `cas2di.tsv` in the folder that contains the UIMA TypeSystem descriptor file, such as `exported_typesystem.xml` or `TypeSystem.xml`.
1. Open the `cas2di.tsv` file with a text editor. Each line in the file specifies a single mapping. The format of the mapping depends on which annotator's annotations you want to map:

    - You can create mappings by using the basic format:

        `UIMA_Type_Name[TAB]WKS_Entity_Type`

        The following example defines mappings between UIMA types produced by the Named Entity Recognition annotator in {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer Content Analytics and entity types defined in a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} type system:

        ```
        com.ibm.langware.Organization  ORGANIZATION
        com.ibm.langware.Person  PERSON
        com.ibm.langware.Location  LOCATION
        ```
        {: screen}

        Another example defines a mapping between UIMA types produced by custom annotator that was created in {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer Content Analytics Studio and {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} entity types:

        ```
        com.ibm.Person  PERSON
        com.ibm.Date  DATE
        ```
        {: screen}

    - You can create mappings based on facets that are used in the Pattern Matcher annotator or Dictionary Lookup annotator in {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer Content Analytics. In text analysis rule files (`*.pat`), the facet is represented as the category attribute. To define a mapping, use the following syntax:

        ```
        com.ibm.takmi.nlp.annotation_type.ContiguousContext:category={FACET_PATH}[TAB]{WKS_ENTITY_TYPE}
        ```
        {: screen}

        The following example, which applies to the Pattern Matcher and Dictionary Lookup annotators, defines a mapping between the category $.mykeyword.product and the {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} entity type PRODUCT:

        ```
        com.ibm.takmi.nlp.annotation_type.ContiguousContext:category=$.mykeyword.product PRODUCT
        ```
        {: screen}

#### What to do next
{: #wks_uimawexmap_next}

You must create a ZIP file that contains all of the files that are required to upload the analyzed data into a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace.

### Uploading UIMA CAS XMI files into a workspace
{: #wks_uimaweximport}

To use the pre-annotated documents that you downloaded to train a model, you must create a ZIP file that contains all the files required to upload the XMI files, and then upload the ZIP file into a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace.

#### Before you begin
{: #wks_uimaweximport_prereqs}

Before you upload the ZIP file, ensure that the type system in your {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace includes the entity types that you mapped the UIMA types to.

> **Warning:** UIMA analysis engines allow annotations to span sentences. In {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}}, annotations must exist within the boundaries of a single sentence. If the XMI files that you upload include annotations that span sentences, those annotations do not appear in the ground truth editor.

#### Procedure
{: #wks_uimaweximport_procedure}

To upload pre-annotated documents into a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace:

1. Create a ZIP file that contains all of the files that are required by {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}}.

    1. Select the folder that contains the XMI files, UIMA type system descriptor file, and `cas2di.tsv` file, or select all of the files in the folder.
    1. Create a ZIP file that includes all files. Make sure the `cas2di.tsv` and UIMA type system descriptor files are stored in the root directory of the ZIP file. These files cannot be stored in a subfolder within the ZIP file or {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} will not be able to read them, and nothing will be imported.

        In Windows, you can right-click and select **Send to** > **Compressed (zipped) folder** .

1. Upload the ZIP file into a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workspace.

    1. Log in as a {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} administrator or project manager, open the workspace that you want to add the documents to, and open the **Assets**> **Documents** page.
    1. Click **Upload Document Sets**.
    1. Drag the ZIP file that you created or click to locate and select the file.
    1. Select the check box to indicate that the ZIP file contains UIMA CAS XMI files.
    1. Click **Upload**.
